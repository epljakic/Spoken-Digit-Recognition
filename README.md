# Spoken digit recognition
### This system is able to recognize 4 spoken digits that are in these 4 separate folders.
### To achieve this, the following steps are required:
- Filtering audio input signals.
- Speech/Silence segmentation based on Teager energy.
- LPC analysis and feature extraction.
- Recognition using ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm.
